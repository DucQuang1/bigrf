Description: This is an implementation of Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler's
  Random Forest algorithms for classification and regression, optimized for data
  sets that are too large to fit or be processed in memory. It utilizes
  bigmemory disk-based memory for caching of intermediate computations, and
  foreach to parallelize the tree-buliding process. This package performs
  particularly well for large data sets that cause excessive virtual memory
  swapping by the OS. Currently, only classification trees with limited
  functionality are implemented. More functions and regression trees will be
  added in the future.
