Changes in version 0.1-3

Updates:

  * Suggests the doParallel that uses the parallel package that ships with R,
    instead of doMC, doMPI, doRedis, doSNOW.

  * Requires R >= 2.14, when the parallel package was released.

Changes in version 0.1-2

Bug Fixes:

  * Set the OS type for this package to unix only, as dependency bigmemory
    is now only available for unix. However, Windows users can still use this
    package by manually downloading and installing bigmemory (windows binary for
    older version available on CRAN) and bigrf (install from source).

  * Added file .gitignore to .Rbuildignore, to pass R CMD check.



Changes in version 0.1-1

  * Initial release
